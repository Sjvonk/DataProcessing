1. Are there any notable differences between states/cities/years? Visualize the differences (or similarities) that you can find.
2. What are the patterns you discovered that you suspect could be interesting? Does the data contain any unusual patterns that you did not expect?
3. How does the pattern between killer/victim look between various incidents over the years.
   Is it mostly family/relation or do we see more reported gang violence for instance?
